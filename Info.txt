Context: Water Distribution System
- Takes purified water and distributes to customers
- Many tanks across the city (7)
- Pumping stations to transport water (11)
- Each node represents a different neighbourhood (lowest division of city unit)

Programmable Logic Computer (PLC) - an industrial computer thats connected to the machines
- stores data and executes commands depending on data receives
- several PLC controlling a water pumps in an area 
- several other PLC reading water level 
- PLCs communicate with each other with data
- When water level in tanks reach a certain level, pumps should be on to bring water in

** Problem (Cybersecurity) **
- Hacker changing the way system is operating 
- Eg. make it seem that water level is low in order to force pumps to pump water (vice versa)
- PLC can receive wrong readings, wrong commands, no commands, no readings
==> Want to determine if system is under attack (0/1 classification problem)
3 datasets
A) (train_dataset01.csv) 1year of obs, 15mins interval. No attacks. See how system is operating
B) (train_dataset02.csv) observations with attacks. The attacks are labeled
C) (test_dataset.csv)     test dataset. Contains attacks (unknown number, unlabeled)

** Dataset contains **
- water level in each tank (float)
- Status (boolean, FALSE for Off/CLosed; TRUE for ON/Open) for each pump
- Flow through each valve and pumping station (Float
- Suction pressure and discharge pressure for each value and pumping station (Float)
- Attack flag for 1st and 2nd set (Boolean: FALSE for Safe; TRUE for under attack)

==> Develop a classification model that tells if the system is under attack or not



** Evaluation Criteria **
F1 score.
The performance of the algorithm will be then evaluated based on their capability of classifying correctly the state of the water distribtution system (SAFE or ATTACK).
Considering the importance of classifying correctly the presence of attacks (which are RARE instances), we will use the F1 score defined as 
F1 = 2 (p*r)/(p+r)
 --> want to put more emphasis on True Postitive (TP) (flag as attack when actually under attack)

** Output **
datestamp + flag -> upload to kaggle
will get the F1 score for a subset of the test data

S1 - Public leaderboard (visible throughout competition)
S2 - Private leaderboard (at the end only)

S1 U S2 = TEST dataset

-- final results are based on private
-- 1st on public =/= 1st on private (due to overfitting)

** Grading **
40 points
20 (private leaderboard) + 10 (public) + 10 report
Report:
- Short document (4 pages max)
- A high level description of the approach develop (Why we chose the model, diagram and elaboration, critical thinking on what we did)
- A short description of results
- a brief discussion on the interpretability and limits of the approach (Why it works and its limitations)
- Executive summary not needed.
- Submit on edimension and submit a zipped file containing the code you developed by 10 Dec
- Code must be runnable (any language)
